# Introduction

### Style

We'll be following the [AirBnb React/JSX Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)

### Branching

We'll be working off of the `main` branch. For each task, you'll create a branch off of the `main` branch and do all of your work there. Your branch should be named something distinct that makes it easy to determine what task it's associated with (e.g. `events-tile`). When you're done, you'll create a pull request in GitHub to merge your branch back into `main`.
